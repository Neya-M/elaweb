We had wandered in the dark woods for a while, trying to find the path. The map was not much use, since we couldn’t find any of the roads or places marked on it. We tried tracing the path back from the Nagual’s cave, but it only got us more lost, as the area was riddled with forks and paths long abandoned. We had been searching for about an hour when I noticed a pair of glowing blue eyes watching us from the trees. 
“Who’s there?” I asked nervously. A creature that I could only describe as a huge white wolf stepped out from the trees. It spoke. 
“Odilia, you and your sisters are not going to find your way back alone. Follow me, and I will guide you back.” 
Another one stepped out of the shadows, and it had black fur instead of white. “He tries to lead you to death. Follow me, and I will protect you.” 
“Which one should we follow?” asked Pita.
“I’m following Odilia. You know the way, right?” Velia said. 
I don’t. I’d been doing my best to get back on track, but I felt like we were just wandering deeper and deeper into the woods. 
“I’m not following another Nagual,” agreed Delia. 
“It’s not a Nagual!” Juanita said. “Seriously, do you not know the legends? It’s the Cadejos!”
“And what do your legends say?” Delia asked. 
“Oh, it’s very simple. The white Cadejo protects and leads travelers, and the black Cadejo kills them!” Juanita said, walking confidently towards the white Cadejo. The others seemed to agree, as they started to follow. 
“Are you sure?” I asked Juanita. Why wouldn’t Teresita have warned us about them? Surely she would’ve seen them in her magic Lotería cards. 
“Don’t be stupid, Odilia. The legends all say that the white one is good,” Juanita said. 
Then I remembered a moment after Teresita warned of the Nagual. A look of confusion, and she put the card down without a word. I trusted Juanita's knowledge, but what would be so strange as to confuse Teresita herself?
We followed the white Cadejo, and the other one slipped silently back into the shadows, shaking its head. The Cadejo led us deeper and deeper in the woods. The night grew darker, but we didn’t seem any closer to the right path. 
“Are you sure we’re going the right way?” Pita asked. 
“Of course we are!” The Cadejo snapped. “Do you doubt me?” It said, giving us a sharp glare and showing its teeth. 
“I really don’t think we followed the right one,” I whispered to Velia. She nodded in agreement. 
“Should we stop following it?” Velia asked.
“Well, I don’t know the way back myself, so this is probably our best chance. Also, Juanita could be right,” I said.
Finally, the Cadejo stopped at a small den. There was still no path in sight, but we’d all grown pretty tired by then. 
“This isn’t the path…” Juanita said.
“Exactly,” the Cadejo said, grinning as its glowing blue eyes shifted to red. Then it pounced. Juanita narrowly dodged it as it slashed at the air in front of her. Velia pulled Pita out of the way as it tried to bite her. I found a sharp stick and tried to jab at it, but it leapt on me, pinning me down. I stabbed at it uselessly, and then my stick snapped in half. Suddenly, another creature launched out of the woods. It was the black Cadejo! It caught us all by surprise, and before the white Cadejo could react, it bit its paw. The white Cadejo howled in pain and limped away, shooting one last glare at us.
After catching our breaths and recovering a bit from the shock, Juanita sat up.
“Why did you save us?” Juanita asked. “Were the legends wrong?”
The Cadejo sighed. “No, the white Cadejo was the ‘good’ one,” it said. “He would guide travelers and protect them from any harm. But more and more, the white Cadejo started getting sick of people. They often didn’t thank him, or they would treat him like a dog, or force him to carry their things.”
“Why would they do that even when he was protecting them?” Pita asked.
“Ha! Sometimes they would say he didn’t protect them well enough, because they got a small scratch or bruise. Eventually, he snapped and attacked a traveler who said he was going too slow.”
“Then why did you start protecting people?” I asked. 
“When I was young, I would kill travelers for the challenge, and thrill. One day, I injured my paw and a very kind person gave me food and helped me heal. Once I was well again, I killed him anyway.”
“What? Why would you do that?” Velia exclaimed.
“I… I guess I didn’t know what else to do. People had never treated me kindly before. But when I killed him, I felt terrible guilt, something I’d never felt before. I hid away for many years, and my story quickly turned to myth, but I eventually returned to protect travelers. It is a punishment for how horrible I was before.”
“Oh. Thank you, Cadejo,” Velia said.
Then, I remembered why we were here. “Oh right! One more thing if you don’t mind,” I said. “Do you know the way to the right path?”
With the directions the Cadejo gave us, we started walking back to the original road. I thought about the two Cadejos, and how good and evil had reversed. I promised to myself that I would be just a little more forgiving of people who were unkind and hostile. Maybe they had been treated the same.

A Word from the Author
The good and evil duo of the Cadejos are very widely known, protecting some and killing others. The black Cadejo is often portrayed as the evil one, while the white Cadejo is good and kind. The Cadejos are large and dog-like, and often appear to people at night. In my new scene for Summer of the Mariposas, I have kept most of the original El Cadejo’s traits so that people can see the original monster in it, but I also changed a few traits to show the theme that things are not always as they appear.
The two representations are very similar. The Cadejos in my story are dog-like, just like the original Cadejos. When Odilia sees the Cadejos for the first time, she describes it as a huge wolf, similar to the original stories people told. Also like the original, there are two Cadejos, one good and one evil. When they meet Odilia and the sisters, they try to lead them in different directions. Juanita also says that one of them is good and the other is evil. In most of the original stories, the Cadejos appeared to people at night. Likewise, in my new scene, the sisters are traveling through the woods at night when the Cadejos appear to them. These similarities make it easier to recognize the monster as El Cadejo, while also setting up background for the key difference between the original and my new scene.
There is one major difference between the two representations: In the original stories, the white Cadejo is the good one and the black Cadejo is the evil one. In my new scene for Summer of the Mariposas, these roles are reversed. In my story, the white Cadejo attacks the sisters and the black Cadejo saves them. Later, the black Cadejo explains that the white Cadejo was mistreated for many years and rarely thanked for its protection, so it got angry and started attacking people. Later on, the black Cadejo started to feel guilty and terrible, so it protects people as a punishment for itself. Just because the black Cadejo used to be evil doesn’t mean it will still be evil now. Just because the white Cadejo is evil doesn’t mean it doesn’t deserve some empathy. This supports the theme that things are not always as they appear.
The original stories of El Cadejo and the representation in my new scene are very similar, so that people can recognize it. There is also one key difference to help show the theme that things are not always as they appear. The story of El Cadejo still has relevance today, though changing the story a bit to show that the Cadejos’ values changed over time will allow readers to realize that people change, for better or worse. People’s actions reflect their background, and unkind people were almost always treated badly before. I hope readers will learn to be more grateful when people are kind to them and be more forgiving when they aren’t.
